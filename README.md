# Minecraft Status

An app to check if a Minecraft server is online.

## Features

The app currently supports getting the server info (number of online and offline players, server software version), displaying the server icon and displaying the formatted server Message-of-the-day (motd).

## Bugs

- Font formatting codes are not fully supported
- Timing out on unreachable servers takes a little longer than intended
